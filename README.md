A pretty useless extension, to be honest. Side effects may include making long-form information slightly more interesting as well as completely unreadable, turning toxic comments humorous, and mild to severe 🅱️.

## Features
- Can be disabled for one domain by clicking on the extension icon (to enable it only on whitelisted sites, go to chrome://extensions and change the "Site access" option to "On specific sites" on the extension's details page)
- Copying 🅱️-ified text to clipboard will preserve the original text
- Works on content fetched dynamically after initial page load
- Lightning fast even on the heaviest of pages
- Free/libre and open source: zero tracking, telemetry, or phoning home
